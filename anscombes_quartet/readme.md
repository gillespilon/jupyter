# Anscombe's quartet

## In brevi

Francis Anscombe created four data sets in 1973 to demonstrate the value of graphical analysis before statistical analysis. Each set of 11 x-y pairs has nearly identical descriptive statistics and different graphical analyses.

## Data

Download the data sets.

[anscombes_quartet_1.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzrdQfHR2I5DQXNaMU83Yjljb1U). The data form a linear relationship with variation around the regression line.

[anscombes_quartet_2.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzrdQfHR2I5DcVE4QlA3OWx0eEE). The data form a curved relationship.

[anscombes_quartet_3.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzrdQfHR2I5DUXljMHRhend6d28). The data form a linear relationship with very little variation around the regression line, and one severe outlier.

[anscombes_quartet_4.csv](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzrdQfHR2I5DTzZtUnVrTWJWUmc). The data form a vertical relationship and one extreme outlier.

## Methodology

I will write the methodology for this repository.
